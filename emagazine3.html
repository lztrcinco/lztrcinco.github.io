        <p>It was wicked having the very cool Paul Hewitt from AONO barbers in with us, acting as a guest judge here at London School of Barbering, for our recent barber battle and graduation day of our newly skilled barber recruits, who completed the NVQ 2 Diploma in barbering.</p>
        <p>Paul Hewitt owns and operates AONO in Brighton, a barbershop combined with a tattoo parlour and AONO streetwear brand.</p>
        <p>He was a barber for years, before he founded AONO in Brighton in 2011.</p>
        <p>AONO which stands for 'Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned' is one of the UK's premier barbershops, where tattoos and stylish streetwear overlap. AONO brings the world of barbering, tattoos and streetwear together; operating as a multifunctional brand.</p>
        <p>Paul has rich roots within the barbering and tattoo community, along with a deep love for streetwear, which lead him to establish AONO as a lifestyle brand, where he started off selling a small range of AONO logo t-shirts out of his barbershop.</p>
        <p>He has a strong motto that he applies to his work every day and that motto is <b><i>Passion Over Profit,</i></b> something we should all live by, right?</p>
        <p>Paul is also an Uppercut Deluxe ambassador.</p>
        <p>We would like to congratulate all of our students who duelled it out on their final last day. Paul Hewitt spent over 4 hours judging haircuts, had a special Q&A with students, and even did a professional demonstration for us all. It was a memorable day for our new aspiring barbers overall and we have to give thanks to Paul for being so generous with his time and words.</p>
        <p>Paul was specifically impressed with the edgy and advanced cuts that he was seeing from students. Fabio took away first place, Wagner from Brazil was second, and Shamirah won third. There was a very nice balance of scissor cuts, clipper cuts and even lining with straight razors. The students definitely made their educators proud!</p>
        <p>We are undeniably excited for these grads to be hitting the barbering scene of London, around the UK and abroad, embarking on their new career of growing into master barbers.</p>
