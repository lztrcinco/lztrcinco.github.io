        <p>Huge thanks to barber guru Joe Sloan for committing his time to be a guest judge at another London School of Barbering student competition. Joe is an example of a barber who has achieved lots due to his hard work and we feel very privileged that he chose to share his experience and passion for the trade with our students.</p>
        <p>Joe Sloan boasts a very impressive background in barbering, having built up a well known name for himself in the industry through his hard work, talent and his infectious ambition. He is a master of his craft.</p>
        <p>He is an accomplished barber who delivers top quality mens cuts at Big Yin Hair and Beauty Salons at Essex.</p>
        <p>Joe is also an educator at MHFed (Men's Hairdressing Federation), which is an organisation in the UK that has been set up for hairdressers and barbers who wish to be recognised for high quality styling and finishing of men's hair.</p>
        <p>He is a strong advocate for high standards in the barbering industry, where he understands the immense talent and technical ability required in order to be a professional and successful barber.</p>
        <p>He provided detailed feedback on each haircut and was generally very impressed with the cutting techniques and styles that our LSB students displayed. All the comments are taken on board and the next generation of great barbers, who were complete novices just 9 weeks ago, are now ready to hit the whole UK barbering scene and make their mark.</p>
        <p>We congratulate our student Joe (same name as judge by coincidence) for winning first place with his beautiful and precise haircut. We also commend all the other students for executing such great haircuts - great training pays off.</p>
