        <p>We had a smashing time at Barber Connect 2014 this year. The buzz was tremendous and we absolutely loved the show which has gained pace in the last two years and can now pride itself to be a unique platform for lots of talented barbers from UK and around the world to come together and promote the barbering community.</p>
        <p>The highlights of the show for us were:</p>
        <div>
            <ul class="a">
                <li>The LSB team - Mike, Justis, Stell and Kelly - performing on the stage of MHFed, showcasing our barber skills and displaying top-notch cuts, as well as spreading the word about our unique and intensive training.</li>
                <li>One of our favourite partners - The BlueBeards Revenge holding a great shave competition in a boxing ring and us having the opportunity to promote the Academy and our popular shaving courses with them.</li>
                <li>Educating people on the importance of NVQ qualifications through awarding body VTCT.</li>
                <li>Supporting discussions on licensing the industry and keeping quality at high standards.
                There is even more to come next year - LSB is proud to announce reserving its own stand at Barber Connect 2015!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>We look forward to the next yearâ€™s show and hope to see the barber community expanding. We are thrilled to put up a great performance next year with lots of great hairstyles and cuts, performed by our pro trainers and talented graduates. We will be talking about our unique training philosophy and hope to build more contacts within the growing barbering community.</p><br>
